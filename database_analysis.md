# Database Design Analysis - Inventory Management System

## 1. Schema Design Summary

### Core Tables:
- **companies**: Master data for companies
- **warehouses**: Company-owned storage facilities
- **suppliers**: Product suppliers
- **products**: Product catalog with bundle support
- **inventory**: Current stock levels per warehouse/product
- **inventory_movements**: Historical tracking of all inventory changes

### Relationship Tables:
- **company_suppliers**: Many-to-many relationship between companies and suppliers
- **supplier_products**: What products each supplier provides (with pricing/terms)
- **product_bundles**: Components that make up bundle products

## 2. Key Design Decisions & Justifications

### Data Types & Constraints
- **BIGSERIAL for IDs**: Supports high-volume systems, auto-incrementing
- **DECIMAL for monetary values**: Precise financial calculations (vs FLOAT)
- **VARCHAR with appropriate lengths**: Balance between storage and flexibility
- **CHECK constraints**: Data integrity at database level
- **UNIQUE constraints**: Prevent duplicate business identifiers

### Inventory Tracking Architecture
- **Separate current vs historical**: `inventory` table for current state, `inventory_movements` for audit trail
- **Multiple quantity types**: Available, reserved, damaged for comprehensive tracking
- **Immutable movement log**: Full audit trail with reference tracking

### Indexing Strategy
- **Composite indexes**: warehouse_id + product_id for common queries
- **Time-based indexes**: created_at for movement history queries  
- **Status indexes**: For filtering active/inactive records
- **Foreign key indexes**: Automatic query optimization

### Bundle Product Design
- **Self-referencing relationship**: Products can contain other products
- **Recursive structure support**: Bundles can contain other bundles
- **Quantity specification**: How many of each component in bundle
- **Circular reference prevention**: CHECK constraint prevents self-reference

## 3. Missing Requirements - Questions for Product Team

### Business Logic Clarifications
1. **Multi-tenancy**: Is this a single-tenant system or will multiple organizations use it?
2. **User management**: Who can access what data? Role-based permissions needed?
3. **Bundle inventory**: How should bundle quantities be calculated? Real-time from components or pre-allocated?

### Inventory Management
4. **Stock reservations**: How long are reservations held? Auto-expiry needed?
5. **Negative inventory**: Are negative quantities allowed (backorders)?
6. **Lot/batch tracking**: Do we need to track product batches, serial numbers, or expiry dates?
7. **Location granularity**: Do we need to track specific locations within warehouses (shelves, bins)?

### Supplier Relationships  
8. **Exclusive suppliers**: Can products have exclusive suppliers or always multiple?
9. **Supplier pricing**: Do we need price history, volume discounts, or contract pricing?
10. **Purchase orders**: Do we need to track POs, deliveries, and payments?

### Operational Requirements
11. **Stock movements**: What triggers inventory changes? (sales, purchases, transfers, adjustments)
12. **Approval workflows**: Do inventory adjustments need approval processes?
13. **Reporting needs**: What reports are critical? (stock levels, movements, valuations)
14. **Integration points**: Do we need APIs for POS systems, accounting software, etc.?

### Data Retention & Compliance
15. **Audit requirements**: How long must movement history be retained?
16. **Data archiving**: Should old data be archived vs deleted?
17. **Compliance**: Any industry-specific requirements (pharma, food safety, etc.)?

### Performance & Scale
18. **Expected volume**: How many products, warehouses, transactions per day?
19. **Geographic distribution**: Multiple regions/time zones?
20. **Real-time requirements**: Do stock levels need real-time updates or is eventual consistency okay?

## 4. Additional Design Considerations

### Security & Access Control
- Row-level security for multi-tenant scenarios
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Encryption for sensitive data (costs, supplier terms)

### Performance Optimizations
- Partitioning for large movement tables (by date)
- Read replicas for reporting workloads
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Data Quality
- Referential integrity enforcement
- Business rule validation triggers
- Data validation at application layer

### Scalability Patterns
- Event sourcing for inventory movements
- CQRS for read/write optimization
- Database sharding strategies for high volume

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Low stock level alerts
- Unusual movement pattern detection
- Data quality monitoring
- Performance metric tracking

This design provides a solid foundation while identifying critical gaps that need product team input before implementation.
