# Requirements Verification - Database Schema

## ‚úÖ Requirement Compliance Check

### Requirement 1: "Companies can have multiple warehouses"
**Status: ‚úÖ SATISFIED**
- `companies` table with primary key
- `warehouses` table with `company_id` foreign key
- One-to-many relationship established
- Unique constraint on `(company_id, code)` prevents duplicate warehouse codes per company

### Requirement 2: "Products can be stored in multiple warehouses with different quantities"
**Status: ‚úÖ SATISFIED**
- `inventory` table links `warehouse_id` + `product_id` with `quantity`
- Unique constraint on `(warehouse_id, product_id)` ensures one record per warehouse-product combination
- Same product can exist in multiple warehouses with different quantities
- Many-to-many relationship between products and warehouses via inventory table

### Requirement 3: "Track when inventory levels change"
**Status: ‚úÖ SATISFIED**
- `inventory_movements` table captures all changes
- Fields: `movement_type`, `quantity_change`, `reason`, `performed_by`, `created_at`
- Immutable audit trail (insert-only)
- `last_updated` timestamp on `inventory` table tracks when current levels changed

### Requirement 4: "Suppliers provide products to companies"
**Status: ‚úÖ SATISFIED**
- `suppliers` table for supplier entities
- `supplier_products` table creates many-to-many relationship
- Links `supplier_id`, `product_id`, AND `company_id`
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate supplier-product-company combinations

### Requirement 5: "Some products might be 'bundles' containing other products"
**Status: ‚úÖ SATISFIED**
- `products.is_bundle` boolean flag identifies bundle products
- `product_bundles` table for bundle composition
- Self-referencing relationship: `bundle_product_id` ‚Üí `component_product_id`
- `quantity` field specifies how many of each component
- CHECK constraint prevents self-reference (product can't contain itself)

## üìã Schema Quality Assessment

### Data Types & Constraints
- **BIGSERIAL**: Appropriate for high-volume systems
- **VARCHAR with limits**: Prevents runaway data growth
- **NOT NULL**: Enforced on critical fields
- **CHECK constraints**: Data integrity (quantity >= 0, no self-reference)
- **UNIQUE constraints**: Business rule enforcement
- **Foreign keys**: Referential integrity

### Indexing Strategy
- **Primary keys**: Automatic clustered indexes
- **Foreign key indexes**: Query optimization for joins
- **Composite indexes**: `(warehouse_id, product_id)` for common queries
- **Time-based indexes**: `created_at` for movement history queries

### Performance Considerations
- Separate current state (`inventory`) from history (`inventory_movements`)
- Indexes on common query patterns
- Timestamp trigger for automatic updates
- Optimized for both transactional and reporting queries

## üîç Design Decisions Explained

### 1. Separate Inventory vs Movements Tables
**Decision**: Two tables instead of event sourcing
**Justification**: 
- Fast current state queries without aggregation
- Complete audit trail preserved
- Balance between query performance and data integrity

### 2. Supplier-Product-Company Relationship
**Decision**: Three-way relationship instead of two separate tables
**Justification**:
- Models real business: suppliers provide specific products to specific companies
- Supports different pricing/terms per company
- Prevents orphaned supplier-product relationships

### 3. Bundle Design
**Decision**: Self-referencing product table with separate bundles table
**Justification**:
- Flexible: bundles can contain other bundles
- Simple: products are products, bundles are just a special type
- Extensible: easy to add bundle-specific attributes later

### 4. Movement Tracking
**Decision**: Quantity change field instead of before/after quantities
**Justification**:
- Atomic operation recording
- Easier to sum for historical analysis
- Clearer intent (what changed vs what resulted)

### 5. Timestamp Handling
**Decision**: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
**Justification**:
- Multi-timezone support
- Unambiguous time recording
- PostgreSQL best practice

## üéØ Schema Completeness

The schema fully addresses all stated requirements while maintaining:
- **Data integrity** through constraints
- **Performance** through strategic indexing  
- **Flexibility** for future extensions
- **Auditability** through complete movement tracking
- **Scalability** through appropriate data types and relationships

The design is production-ready for the specified requirements.
